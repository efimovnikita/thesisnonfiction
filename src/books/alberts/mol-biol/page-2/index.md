As we will explain, although environmental factors affect the incidence of cancer and are critical for some forms of the disease, it would be wrong to conclude that they are the only cause of cancers. No matter how hard we try to prevent cancer by healthy living, we will never be able to eradicate this disease. To devise effective treatments, we need to derive a deep understanding of the biology of cancer cells and the mechanisms that underlie the growth and spread of tumors.
