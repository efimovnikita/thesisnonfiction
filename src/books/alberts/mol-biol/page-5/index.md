Gap junctions in many tissues can be opened or closed in response to extracellular or intracellular signals. The neurotransmitter dopamine, for example, reduces gap-junction communication within a class of neurons in the retina in response to an increase in light intensity. This reduction in gap-junction permeability alters the pattern of electrical signaling and helps the retina switch from using rod photoreceptors, which are good detectors of low light, to cone photoreceptors, which detect color and fine detail in bright light.
