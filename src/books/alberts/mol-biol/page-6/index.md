In general, GAGs are strongly hydrophilic and tend to adopt highly extended conformations, which occupy a huge volume relative to their mass. Thus GAGs act as effective “space fillers” in the extracellular matrix of connectlve tissues.

Even at very low concentrations, GAGs form hydrophilic gels: their multiple negative charges attract a cloud of cations, such as Na+, that are osmotically active, causing large amounts of water to be sucked into the matrix.
